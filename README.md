Classification with DecisionTree, KNN, SVM, &amp; RandomForest with PCA.

Clustring using LloydKmeans, FuzzyCmeans, &amp; DBSCAN.

Classification problem on the Maternal Health Risk Dataset and Parkinson's Disease Classification Dataset using PCA.

Clustering problem on a dataset of points on a 2d plane, using Lloyd's k-means, Fuzzy C-means, and DBSCAN clustering algorithms.
The Elbow method is used to find the optimal number of clusters.

## Classification: Maternal Health Risk
### Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project contains information related to maternal health risks, including features such as age, blood pressure, blood sugar, body temperature, 
and heart rate. The target variable is the risk level, which has been encoded numerically.

### Summary of Results
RandomForest: 84%

KNeighbors: 85%

SVM: 68%

DecisionTree: 87%


## Classification: Parkinson's Disease Detection
### Dataset Information
In this project, we use a dataset containing various voice features to build and evaluate machine learning models for PD classification.
This Dataset contains 754 different features.

### Summary of Results
For Different feature extraction parameter for PCA algorithm, here is the result:
